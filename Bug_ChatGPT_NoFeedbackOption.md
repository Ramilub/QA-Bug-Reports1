- **Severity:** Medium (UX/Trust issue)  
- **Platforms:**  
  - **Web:** Google Chrome v137.0.7151.69 (64-bit), Windows 11  
  - **Mobile:** iOS 18.3.2, iPhone SE  
- **App Version (iOS):** ChatGPT 1.2025.147  
- **Reproducibility:** 100%

## Description:

There is **no accessible button or interface** to **report a bug or give feedback** in either the **web** or **iOS** versions of ChatGPT.  
This creates a **disconnect between users and developers**, especially when encountering issues that are **not critical enough to block usage** but **important for iterative improvement**.

---

## Steps to Reproduce (Web):

1. Open (https://chatgpt.com/) in Chrome  
2. Log in to your account  
3. Navigate through the sidebar or settings  
4. Observe: **No "Report a problem" button or feedback menu**

---

## Steps to Reproduce (iOS):

1. Open ChatGPT app (v1.2025.147) on iOS  
2. Log in and begin using the app  
3. Tap on settings or swipe UI sections  
4. Observe: **No obvious way to submit a bug report or send feedback**

---

## Expected Behavior:

There should be a clear, accessible **"Report a Problem"** or **"Send Feedback"** button in the sidebar or settings.  
This feature should:

- Allow reporting of bugs and UX issues  
- Be available in both **web** and **mobile apps**  
- Optionally filter reports by **bug**, **suggestion**, or **other**

---

## Actual Behavior:

- There is **no visible feedback option** for regular users  
- Users cannot share bugs, inconsistencies, or issues (e.g., UI misbehavior, keyboard glitches, missing features)

---

## User Insight:

As a QA tester and active user, I can understand that:
- The decision to **not show a feedback button** may be intentional to reduce noise  
- Many users may submit irrelevant or emotional reports  
- However, **power users**, testers, and real customers **need a channel** to reach developers

---

## Suggested Fix:

- Introduce a simple, structured feedback form:
  - “What went wrong?” → text
  - “Include screenshot?” → optional
  - “Category” → bug, feature request, confusion, other
- Show it in both:
  - Web version (sidebar or user menu)
  - iOS app (settings or bottom sheet)

---

## Impact:

- **Trust loss:** Users may think developers don’t care or are unreachable  
- **Frustration:** Cannot share helpful bug reports or UI issues  
- **Quality loss:** Developers may miss critical early-stage feedback

---

## Business Risk:

- Lack of feedback slows down product improvement  
- Users feel isolated from product direction  
- Can lead to **lower retention**, especially among technically engaged users
